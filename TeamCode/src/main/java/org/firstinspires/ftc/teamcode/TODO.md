# Next steps with camera

- [x] Find which direction (x) to turn the camera to focus on a target tag
- [X] Refactor into a camera class in the robot package
- [ ] Make camera agnostic
- [x] Add y axis
- [ ] Test framerates and quality to find balance & make sure it does not take too much cpu time
- [ ] Test on an actual robot to see if motion blur is an issue (pray motion blur isent too big of a deal)
